Orekit, a low level space dynamics library written in Java, has gained widespread recognition since it was released under an open source license in 2008.

Orekit aims at providing accurate and efficient low level components for the development of flight dynamics applications. It is designed to be easily used in very different contexts, from quick studies up to critical operations.

Orekit is freely available both in source and binary formats, with all related documentation and tests.

As a library, Orekit provides basic elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames, ...) and various algorithms to handle them (conversions, propagations, pointing, ...).
