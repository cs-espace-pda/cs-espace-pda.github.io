Overview
--------

<img class="image-right" src="product_s2p_screenshot.png" width="50%">

S2P (Satellite Stereo Pipeline) is a Python library and command line tool that implements a stereo pipeline which produces elevation models from images taken by high resolution optical satellites such as Pl√©iades, WorldView, QuickBird, Spot or Ikonos. It generates 3D point clouds and digital surface models from stereo pairs (two images) or tri-stereo sets (three images) in a completely automatic fashion.

A wide variety of stereo correlation algorithms are supported, including several flavors of semi-global matching (SGM), TV-L1 optical flow, etc.

S2P was used to win the 2016 IARPA Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping Challenge.



Features
--------

{{page.v_lib}}'s main features are:
* The pipeline is implemented in the Python package s2p.
* It can produce surface models and 3D point clouds from arbitrarily large regions of interest or from complete images. 
* If needed, it cuts the region of interest in several small tiles and process them in parallel.

Technical caracteristics
------------------------

Software languages are:
* Python
* C

{{page.v_lib}} is compliant with the following operating systems:
* Linux RedHat 6+
* CentOS 6+
* Ubuntu 12+
