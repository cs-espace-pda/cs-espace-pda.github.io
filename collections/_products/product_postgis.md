Overview
--------

{{page.v_lib}} adds extra types (geometry, geography, raster and others) to the PostgreSQL database. 
It also adds functions and indexes that apply to those types. 

It does this by:
* Building a C library that PostgreSQL can load into a postgres backend.
* Binding the functions and structures in that library to SQL types and functions.
