EODAG is a Jupiter plugin that provides a single interface to all DIAS.

EODAG (Earth Observation Data Access Gateway) is a command line tool and a plugin-oriented Python framework for searching, aggregating results and downloading remote sensed images while offering a unified API for data access regardless of the data provider. The EODAG SDK is structured around three functions:
* List product types: list of supported products and their description
* Search products (by product type or uid) : searches products according to the search criteria provided
* Download products : download product “as is”
