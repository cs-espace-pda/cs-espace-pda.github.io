The REGARDS project (REnouvellement des outils Génériques d’Accès et d’aRchivage pour les Données Spatiales) is at the convergence between two Data Preservation and valorization tools, SIPAD-NG and SITools2. It is a full ground segment product and it can be used by any data center in charge of the implementation of data archiving and/or in charge of a mission or a data center access (research lab or IT services company).
