On-line services

Spatial imagery generates layers of data that can be combined with other information in a geographic information system or GIS that is designed to collect, store, process, analyze, manage and present all types of spatial and geographic data.

Our key references in this domain are the [CAIAC project](project-hcfdc-caiac-en.html), the [SUPERVISION Nîmes project](project-métropole-de-nîmes-supervision-nîmes-en.html).

We develop several solutions for the French agency of the hydrometeorological and flood forecasting (SCHAPI): the [PLATHYNES project](project-schapi-plathynes-en.html), the [POM project](project-schapi-pom-en.html) and the [SUPERVISEUR NATIONAL project](project-schapi-superviseur-national-en.html).
