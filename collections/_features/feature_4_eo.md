CS GROUP is a specialist in services and applications that enhance the value of spatial data.  This know-how is divided into two main areas:

* on-line services for the exploitation of spatial data;
* risk management, including GIS-based risk management for environmental applications.

On-line services
----------------

CS Group develops turnkey solutions for the exploitation of spatial data, including: Web portal, virtual desktop, support and training.

Our key references in this domain are the [RUS project](project-ec-rus-en.html), the [WEkEO Support project](project-eumetsat-wekeo-support-en.html) and the AI4GEO project.


Risk Management
---------------

Spatial imagery may be combined with other sources of information in a geographic information system platform. It is designed to smoothly collect, store, process, analyze, manage and present all types of spatial/temporal geographic data. 

Critical operators and territorial managers take advantage of the [CAIAC](project-hcfdc-caiac-en.html) platform in their planning, decision support, risk and crisis management activities. 

We develop several solutions for the French agency of the hydrometeorological and flood forecasting (SCHAPI): the [PLATHYNES project](project-schapi-plathynes-en.html), the [POM project](project-schapi-pom-en.html) and the [SUPERVISEUR NATIONAL project](project-schapi-superviseur-national-en.html) and for local agencies in charge of flood management as for the [SUPERVISION Nîmes project](project-métropole-de-nîmes-supervision-nîmes-en.html).
