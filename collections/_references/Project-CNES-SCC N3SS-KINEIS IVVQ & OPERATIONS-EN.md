# Context


CS Group responsabilities for SCC IVV, support in Technical and Operational Qualification and LEOP operations of N3SS et KINEIS missions are as follows:
* Piloting by CS GROUP of the IVV. Piloting by CNES of TQ/OQ tests and support for the LEOP and routine phases of the 5 KINEIS constellation launches

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-SCC N3SS-KINEIS IVVQ & OPERATIONS-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **AIV **: Development of LDP procedures and missionary, definition of strategy, automated plans and execution of tests (AIV tools for managing contexts, results, requirements)
	**QT/QO ** system tests: preparation and support for the execution of compatibility/qt/qo tests, development of operational procedures
	**Support for operations **: Resources integrated in CNES teams for launch, the recipe in flight and beginning of life (shifts, soil clips)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Assistance to engineering and support for the realization of ** Integration, System and operations qualification ** of the ** segments of control of the n3ss satellite and the KINEIS ** constellation implementing the ** line of Isis products**
* Missionary and ISIS Integration on Cluster Science and Cloud
* Development of the CNES/ESA/NASA IOAG demonstrator

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, If): Jira
* Specific assembly process, integration, validation qualification of control soil segments
* Tests qualification system for control soil segments: compatibility, technical and operational qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Configuration and deployment of SCCs: nominal, rescue, SCP/SSV (experts) and test lines
* Operational qualification channel TM/TC Isis: BDS configurations, sessions, Sle, COP, catalogs, TM visualization, TC Histo
* Implementation of ISIS operational concepts: procedures, automation 
* Experienced AIV team for rapid skill rise
