# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Evaluation of the SODA method to characterize gaseous content in the atmosphere are as follows:
* Prototype development and results analysis

![Main Picture](Project-CSGROUP-SODA-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Development of a prototype :**
* Atmospheric correction with SOS-ABS for different gas content
* Soda coefficient calculations with two different methods 
* Estimation of optimal content for each gas considered
	**Results analysis :**
* Generation of a database to be treated from SOS-ABS for 9 different surfaces
* Selection of the optimal spectral interval for each gas
* Analysis of results as a function of the surface type

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Evaluate a water vapor inversion method to restore other gas content (O3, CO2, CH4, PSURF)

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Bibliography, prototyping, simulations, analysis

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Incommensurate



The main technologies used in this project are:
