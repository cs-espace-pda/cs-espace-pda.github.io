# Context


CS Group responsabilities for LEO - Orbitography Support are as follows:
* Full delegation of space mechanics operations

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-LEO - ORBITO SUPPORT-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Monitoring of routinely tasks of operational orbital mechanics 
* Contribution to the technical recipes for the validation of anomaly corrections and/or evolutions concerning G2.
* Participation in the operational qualifications needed in order to validate the delivery of a new G2 version.
* Writing of operational procedures.
* Participation at GCO, REDEM (Mission reviews), RETEX (Exploitation reviews)
* Preparation and participation in service withdrawal operations 
* End-of-life operations preparation 
* Development and maintenance of auxiliary tools

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Exploitation of the G2 (one per satellite) mainly responsible of performing orbital mechanic computations and AOCS

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Operations

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Service continuity allowing the computing of hundreds of station keeping manoeuvres.
* Qualified operational support, available for the client requests and responsive to operational emergencies (survival, collision risk â€¦) and to exceptional critic operations as the satellite deorbiting.



The main technologies used in this project are:
