# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Assistance to ISIS project management of the Ceres, Swot, Merlin, N3SS and Kineis missions are as follows:
* * Support managed by the CNES

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-ISIS ENGINEERING-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **ISIS technical specifications**
* Management ** BDS ** and ** Interfaces ** (XML and XIF diagrams)
	**Technical management of subsystems **: monitoring of realization (anomalies, patches, versions)
* Participation in journals, technical meetings and ISIS coordination
* Participation in ** Industrial Revenues**
* Participation in ** AIV tests and systems **: qualification of the TM/TC channel: generation bd satellite, LDP configuration
	**Support for operations **: Participation in launch, the recipe in flight and beginning of life

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Engineering and AMOA support for satellite control ground segments implementing the line of ISIS control control products

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): DOORS
* Tests qualification system for control soil segments: compatibility, technical and operational qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Engagement of the architecture of control centers
* Operational qualification of TM/TC ISIS channels: BDS configurations, sessions, SLE, COP, catalogs, TM visualization, TC Histo
* AMOA team made up of experienced resources



The main technologies used in this project are:
