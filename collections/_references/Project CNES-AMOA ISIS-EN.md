![Main Picture](Project CNES-AMOA ISIS-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Maintenance of ISIS technical specifications**
	**BDS** and **interfaces** management (XML and XIF schemas)
	**Technical management of subsystems**: follow-up of production (anomalies, patches, versions)
* Participation in ISIS reviews, technical and coordination meetings
* Contribution to **industrial revenue**
* Participation in **AIV and systems tests**: qualification of the TM/TC chain: BD Satellite generation, LdP configuration
	**Support to Operations**: participation in the launch, in-flight acceptance and start of life

# Project implementation
