# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Studies for the calibration of VENuS are as follows:
* Study, development, in-flight acceptance support

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE VENUS-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Improvement of the lunar disk extraction method (Laplace filter)
* Quantification of CT1 and CT2 type residual noise
* Analysis of temporal drift after updating official parameters (PO) 
* Saving in calculation time by band-to-band reprojection
* New pixel filtering method
* Improvement of the statistical results file
* Comparison to desert method calibrations
* Analysis of the Moon and Deserts calibration results of a new phase corresponding to a change in altitude
