# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Studies for the calibration of Venus are as follows:
* Study, development, recipe support in flight

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE VENUS-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Improvement of the lunar disk extraction method (Laplace filter)
* Quantification of residual noise of type CT1 and CT2
* Analysis of the temporal drift after updating of official parameters (PO) 
* Gain in computing time by reprunction band to band
* New pixel filtering method
* Improvement of the statistical results file
* Comparison to calibrations of the desert method
* Analysis of the moon calibration results and deserts of a new phase corresponding to an altitude change
