# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Sentinel-2 Optical Mission Performance Cluster are as follows:
* ESL (Expert Support Laboratories) Coordination,
* ESL L1 Radiometry Lead,
* L1 Processor Prototyping (S2 IPF),
* Tools Maintenance (QCC).

![Main Picture](Project-ACRI-ST-S2 OPT-MPC-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Calibration – update on-board and on-ground configuration data to meet product quality requirements
* Validation – assess the quality of generated data products
* Quality Control – routinely monitor status of the sensor and check if derived products meet quality requirements along mission lifetime. 
* Data processors evolutions definition
* End-to-end system performance monitoring – monitor performance of Sentinel-2 system operations (including the instrument) and assess the system.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Sentinel-2 Image Quality Control & Calibration & Validation
