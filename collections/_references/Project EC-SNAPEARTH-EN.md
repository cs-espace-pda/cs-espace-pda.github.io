# Context


![Main Picture](Project EC-SNAPEARTH-EN pict 1.png)

CS Group responsabilities are as follows:
* Design, Development, Integration


The features are as follows:
* Index Sentinel images for easy access via a Qwant "EarthSearch" engine. 
* 4 pilot projects aim to take advantage of this indexing with the implementation of the services: Agriculture, Press, Climate and Food-Security. 
* The EarthSelf-Service enables any business or user to take advantage of highly scalable cloud environments for analysis, visualization and production of EO value-added services.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Fostering EO market uptake thanks to natural and holistic access to added value data generated through cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technologies.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile, Continuous integration

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Big data technologies and distributed cloud computing
* Access to the produced database “EarthSignature” and to satellite products
* Cloud agnosticity & multi DIAS hybridization
* Container based infrastructure with fast service deployment 
* Integrated workflow engine
