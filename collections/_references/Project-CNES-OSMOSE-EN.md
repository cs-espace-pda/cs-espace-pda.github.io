# Context

OSMOSE is used in a European effort to construct an independent orbit catalog in order to assess on its own the space situation and tend towards a safe, regulated and sustainable in-orbit environment

CS Group responsabilities for French Space Surveillance and Tracking Framework are as follows:
* Design, development, int√©gration, studies, calibrations, maintenance

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-OSMOSE-EN pict 1.jpg)

The features are as follows:
* Main features: 
	* Scheduling of TAROT telescope observations 
	* Measure associations 
	* Orbit computations
	* Maneuver characterization
	* Orbit catalog provision
	* Multi-source data exploitation

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* OSMOSE consists in scheduling TAROT telescope network observations and use other european measurements to produce and maintain a GEO orbit catalog

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Monolithic, API REST (soon to be removed)
