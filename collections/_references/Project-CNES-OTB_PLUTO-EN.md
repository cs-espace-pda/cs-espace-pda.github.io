# Context

The PLUTO portal aims to bring together and promote open source satellite image processing tools. It is a community portal open to user contributions.
It thus groups together various resources (description for tools, tutorials), or points to existing resources if existing.
In addition to the development of the portal, the project aims to develop some of the tools presented on PLUTO in order to make them more mature or to offer missing functionalities, to promote their use alone or in processing chains.
In this context, the OTB being a PLUTO tool, CS GROUP stays in charge of its maintenance. This maintenance was already the responsibility of CS GROUP in the past (renewed activity). 
The OTB (Orfeo Toolbox) is an open source library offering a large number of efficient satellite image processing applications, for optical or radar imagery.

CS Group responsabilities for Development of web portal PLUTO and maintenance of the Orfeo Toolbox are as follows:
* Software Development
* Maintenance
* User Support
