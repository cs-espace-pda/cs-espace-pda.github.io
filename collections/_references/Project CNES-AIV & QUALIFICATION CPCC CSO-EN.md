![Main Picture](Project CNES-AIV & QUALIFICATION CPCC CSO-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **AIV**: development of operational procedures, definition of plans and automated execution of tests
	**Specification and Development of components** DAC (archiving), RESA (reservation of SOL stations), GLV management of LVs, management of encryptors, DESKTOP
	**Interface engineering**
	**Quality Support** for developments and AIV (Qualification Files)
	**QT/OQ System** tests: preparation and support for the execution of tests
	**Support to Operations**: rounds and on-call duty on the GROUND and MISSION
	**Technical support** to FDS, MAP teams

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Support for the qualification of the CPCC CSO for the launches of the RECO1 (2018) and IDENT (2020) satellites

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): Testlink and Excel
* Specific Process for Assembly, Integration, Validation Qualification of Control Ground Segments
* Qualification system tests of control ground segments: Compatibility, Technical and Operational Qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Successful implementation of a first functional alternative solution in less than 6 months based on OpenCenter
* Very tense schedule challenging for the teams
* Strong reactivity of the development team
* Deployment of a multisat solution on an operational monosat center
* Complex mission: chronology of bi-satellite activities, satellite carrying the COA
