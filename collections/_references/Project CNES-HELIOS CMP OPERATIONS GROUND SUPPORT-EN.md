# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Support to ground operations of the Maintenance Center at Post Helios 2A / 2B are as follows:
* Reinforce the CNES teams, maintain the CMPs in operational conditions, respect the operational constraints

![Main Picture](Project CNES-HELIOS CMP OPERATIONS GROUND SUPPORT-EN pict 2.jpg)

The features are as follows:
* **Operation of the CMP**, namely :
* 24-hour GROUND on-call duty: operational monitoring of conf. hardware and software
* Monitoring of installations, guarantee of software integrity
* Participation in operational meetings 
* Support for the tests of the Bord, Mission, Orbito teams
	**Technical management of subsystems** (STS, DUTCH, CGCU, EGM, OMGS, FOS/ARPE, CCS, etc.), namely:
* Monitoring of software vis-Ã -vis the industrial resp. maintenance 
* Validation of new versions
* On-call support if software problems
* Preparation for CNES software follow-up commissions

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Ensure operations for the GROUND operating service of the Station Maintenance Centers of HELIOS satellites in delegation of tasks
* MCO (Maintenance in operational conditions) of the ground means used to ensure the operations of the satellites of the HELIOS sector

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* V Cycle

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Maintenance of skills to ensure the MCO and support to operations over a very long period
