# Context

CNES is in charge of LEOP GALILEO satellites for IOV (In Orbit validation) and FOC (Full Operational Capability) phases.
Industrial organization: CS GROUP with ALTRAN as subcontractor
Satellites: ADS and OHB
Also RAO in 2015 for the WP6 and GSOP phases
Environment: ESOC (MOIS, SCOS2000)

CS Group responsabilities for GALILEO On-board Operation Support are as follows:
* Ground assets preparation, support for LEOP operations of the constellation's satellites

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-GALILEO ON-BOARD OPERATION SUPPORT-EN pict 2.jpg)

The features are as follows:
* SOE Position (Spacecraft Operations Engineer) for DHS, TTC and AOCS subsystems
* Training on ESOC and CNES ground segment
* Production and validation of Flight Operations and associated files (monitoring, displays, mimics, â€¦)
* Support for following up the on-board team
* Participation to the simulation exercices (SVT, QO and LEOP)
* Participation in project reviews
* Participation in LEOP

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Support to the CNES OP sub-directorate for the preparation and monitoring of LEOP operations for the satellites of the Galileo constellation

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Support

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* European context: CNES / ESOC / Astrium / OHB
* GALILEO platforms and ESOC and CNES ground facilities; On-board DHS, AOCS, TTC subsystems of IOV and FOC platforms
* Operations carried out alternately from ESOC (Darmstadt) or on the CNES site (Toulouse)
* Teams integrated into 24/7 shifts over the duration of LEOP operations
* Project management with subcontracting



The main technologies used in this project are:
