![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE POLARISATION-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Polarized signal sensitivity analysis :**
*     Estimation of the diffusion orders contributing to the polarized signal at the TOA
*     Influence of the aerosol model
*     Influence of surface properties (BRDF, refractive index)
*     Influence of sight geometry and AOT
*     Parametric analysis
	**Representativeness of BPDF models on desert sites :**
*     Comparison of measurements and modeling for different BPDF models
*     Analysis of the results of inversion of the weighting coefficient of the Maignan model
