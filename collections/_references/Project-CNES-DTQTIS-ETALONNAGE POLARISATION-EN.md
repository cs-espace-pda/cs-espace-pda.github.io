![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE POLARISATION-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Polarized signal sensitivity analysis :**
*     Estimation of dissemination orders contributing to the polarized signal to the TOA
*     Influence of the aerosol model
*     Influence of surface properties (BRDF, refraction index)
*     Influence of aiming and AOT geometry
*     Parametric analysis
	**Representativeness of BPDF models on desert sites :**
*     Comparison of measurements and models for different BPDF models
*     Analysis of the Inversion results of the Maignan model weighting coefficient
