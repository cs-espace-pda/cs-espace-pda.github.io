# Context


CS Group responsabilities for CMP IVV, support in Technical and Operational Qualification and LEOP of SWOT mission are as follows:
* * Piloting of the IVV by CS GROUP, TQ/OQ tests by CNES

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-CMP SWOT IVV & QUALIFICATION CMP-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **AIV**: development of procedures and LdP missionization, definition of strategy, plans and automated execution of tests (AIV tools for managing contexts, results, requirements)
	**QT/OQ System Tests**: preparation and support for the execution of compatibility/QT/OQ tests, development of ground operational procedures
	**Operations Support**: resources integrated into the CNES teams for launch, in-flight acceptance and start of life (shifts, ground on-call duties)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Engineering assistance and support for carrying out the **integration and system qualification of the SWOT Satellite Installation and Maintenance Center** implementing the **ISIS Product Line**
* ISIS missionization and integration on science cluster

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): Testlink and Excel
* Specific process of Assembly, Integration, Validation Qualification of Ground Control Segments
* Ground control segment qualification system tests: Compatibility, Technical and Operational Qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Configuration and deployment of CMPs: Nominal, Backup, SCP/SSV (experts) and test lines
* TM/TC ISIS chain operational qualification: BDS configurations, sessions, SLE, COP, catalogs, TM visualization, TC history
* Implementation of ISIS operational concepts: procedures, automation 
* Experienced AIV team for rapid skills development
