![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-AMELIORATION TRANSFERT RADIATIF-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **SOS-ABS :**
*     Gaseous absorption management: Introduction of the CKD method, optimization of the atmospheric profile 
*     Introduction of the Maignan BPDF model
*     Definition of the aerosol model by multi-modes mixture
*     Simplification of use: Warning Word Erroned key, possibility of simultaneous treatments
	**Osoaa :**
*     User advice
*     Training during "Ocean Optics XXV"
	**Support for the integration of SOS-ABS in 4A/OP**
	**Introduction training for radiative transfer**
