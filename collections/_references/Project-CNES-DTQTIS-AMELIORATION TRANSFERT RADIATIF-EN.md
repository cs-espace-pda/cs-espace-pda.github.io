# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Study of improvement of radiative transfer codes are as follows:
* Method specification, development, validation, user support

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-AMELIORATION TRANSFERT RADIATIF-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **SOS-ABS :**
*     Management of gaseous absorptions: introduction of the CKD method, optimization of the atmospheric profile 
*     Introduction of the Maignan BPDF model
*     Definition of the aerosol model by multi-mode mixing
*     Simplification of use: incorrect keyword warning, possibility of simultaneous processing
	**OSOAA :**
*     User Tips
*     Training during “Ocean Optics XXV”
	**Support for the integration of SOS-ABS in 4A/OP**
	**Introductory radiative transfer training**

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Evolutionary maintenance of SOS-ABS and OSOAA codes
