# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Absolute radiometric calibration - 3MI performance review are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-NULL-DTQTIS-BILAN PERFORMANCES 3MI-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Development of a simulator applying a calibration error to PARASOL measurements and carrying out a statistical analysis of the impact on radiometry.**
	**Application to sensitivity estimates :**
*     - uncertainties about the orientation of the polarizers
*     - ignorance of the extinction rate of polarizers 
*     - error in the relative transmission between channels of a triplet of polarizers
*     - HF equalization noise and radiometric noise
*     - non-linearity error

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Analyze 3MI performance against specifications

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Study, regular meetings

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Reference simulated images
* L1 level inversion module at measurement
* Instrumental Radiometric Model modification module
* Module for passing measurements to L1 data
* Images generated with calibration error
* Image gap analysis module



The main technologies used in this project are:
