# Context


CS Group responsabilities for OCC – Orbitography Support are as follows:
* Collisions risk hotline (maintenance and support)

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-SCOOP - COO-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* SCOOP maintenance :40 independent modules, interacting with the ground stations’ network, control centers or other pieces of software.
* Routine operations : daily activities, called routine operations, consist in the implementation and proper functioning of the real-time acquisitions and computations 
* Critical operations : involved in every phases of a satellite’s lifetime, from launch to atmospheric re-entry, including station keeping and collisions monitoring
* Support to external entities (NASA, ESA, DLR,…)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Carry out the necessary maintenance as well as the evolutions of the SCOOP software suite.
* Provide support to OCC operators during routine and critical operations

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* V Cycle, Operations

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Continuous service
* Competent and available support adapted to the client needs
* Tailored maintenance
* Monthly reporting
