# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Technical support to AOCS studies for Microscope are as follows:
* Studies and development of tools and simulators, AOCS support for functional validation on the validation test bed



The features are as follows:
* Tuning of the mode convergence
* Modeling with Simulink of the environment, the dynamic, the equipments and the AOCS flight software
* Development of scripts for calculating the values ​​of the discrete filters of the flight software
* Development of scripts for time and frequency analysis
* Setting the AOCS Convergence
* Optimized flight software settings
* Specification of flight software for studies
* Documentation writing
* Functional validation tests.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* The objective of the service was to provide a technical support to AOCS studies for Microscope. These activities include the design of the AACS (Attitude and Accelerations Control System) of the satellite Microscop

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* V Cycle

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* The phase B needed the development of 3 tools :
	**BIPCA** (enabling the analytical assessment of performance)
	**Simplified AOCS simulator using Simulink and Macsim**
* For these tools, many modelings necessary and many Matlab scripts developed to configure the filters of measurements from stellar trackers and accelerometers and to analyze these measurements



The main technologies used in this project are:
