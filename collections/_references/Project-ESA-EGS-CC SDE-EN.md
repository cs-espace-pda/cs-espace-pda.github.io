# Context

Team: 3 FTE (6 persons)

CS Group responsabilities for European Ground System – Common Core – Software Development Environment are as follows:
* Development, Maintenance

![Main Picture](Project-ESA-EGS-CC SDE-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* CS GROUP was in charge of defining and integrating a complete SDE supporting the expected functions (figure p.2).
* Moreover, CS GROUP was in charge of defining all tools, relevant procedures, configurations, scripts, exchange formats, user guide and other artefacts needed to implement the complete workflow implementing the software lifecycle workflow meeting the EGS-CC requirements.
* Furthermore, the SDE was designed to be easily deployable by all the parties involved in the EGS-CC initiative and allow fluid and frequent exchange of software, documentation and ancillary information.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* ESA needed a comprehensive SDE (Software Development Environment) that can be used for the development, integration, validation and maintenance of the EGS-CC software and production of the associated documentation.
* This SDE was intended to be shared with the Phase C/D industrial consortium and the other EGS-CC integrators.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Proof of Concept, analysis and selection of technologies potentially applicable to the EGS-CC system.

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Very good knowledge of the overall EGS-CC development requirements and lifecycle.
* Thorough hands-on experience with all tools of the EGS-CC SDE
