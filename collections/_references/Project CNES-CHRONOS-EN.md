# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Realization of a processing orchestrator and mission for SWOT are as follows:
* Specification & Design
* Realization of developments
* Mission Statement

![Main Picture](Project CNES-CHRONOS-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Running workflows on local, HPC or Cloud resources (no locking)
* Exploitation: 
	* Ergonomic and modern web HMI;
	* Monitoring the execution of workflows;
	* Visualization of the links between input data, processing chains and output data;
	* Alerts and acknowledgements;
	* Access to logs, execution contexts, pause/resume.
* Monitoring: HMI activity report; System status monitoring.
* Security: Management of access rights; High availability.
* Efficient: 200K tasks / day, 100M processing instances, 500M references.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Design, build and commission a generic processing orchestrator for the SWOT data production centre.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Software V-Model, Requirement engineering, Continuous Integration

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* HPC/Cloud hybridization for running processing workflows using Apache Mesos and SafeScaleâ„¢
* Workflow description with CWL standard
* Integration of many COTS and in particular the TOIL workflow manager
* Micro-service architecture
* Easy to maintain: API; Extension points for HMIs; Extensible data model.
