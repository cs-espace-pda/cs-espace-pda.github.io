# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Calibration study of the PRISMA hyperspectral sensor are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE HYPERSPECTRAL PRISMA-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Comparison of interpolation methods (cubic spline vs hyperspectral method) 
* Analysis of the influence of the reference sensor (Sentinel-2 vs Sentinel-3) on the calibration results 
* Analysis of the influence of AOT (default value, MODIS, CAMS)
* Analysis of the influence of aerosol models
* Comparison with MUSCLE (multispectral, cubic spline)
* Analysis of the different campaigns
