# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Calibration study of the hyperspectral sensor prisma are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE HYPERSPECTRAL PRISMA-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Comparison of interpolation methods (cubic spline vs hyperspectral method) 
* Analysis of the influence of the reference sensor (Sentinel-2 vs Sentinel-3) on the calibration results 
* Analysis of the influence of the AOT (default value, modis, CAMS)
* Analysis of the influence of aerosol models
* Comparison with muscle (multispectral, cubic spline)
* Analysis of different campaigns

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Adapt the inter-stretchy method to desert sites, applicable to multi-mind sensors, to a hyperspectral sensor 
* Test the tool on prisma data

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Study, tests, regular progress points

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Incommensurate
