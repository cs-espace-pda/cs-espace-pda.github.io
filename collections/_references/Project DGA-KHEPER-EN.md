# Context


![Main Picture](Project DGA-KHEPER-EN pict 1.png)

CS Group responsabilities are as follows:
* Project manager in partnership with Magellium and Geo212


The features are as follows:
* Architecture design and distribution of activities to the partners,
* Hardware, software and equipments supply,
* Specific developments contribution (e.g.  the Information System portal),
* Validation and installation activities,
* Operators, workshop leaders and managers training,
* Integrated Logistic Support (ILS).

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* To provide armed forces a shared and relevant cartographic reference for a common understanding of the operational conditions in the perspective of preparing/running military operations, via workshops for:
	* Production (scanned maps, vector and raster data)
	* Control and planification
	* Diffusion

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Continuous integration

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Modern technical solution (WEB, SOA),
* Efficient software in the raster and vector data management,
* Geo-library information portal compliant with new standards,
* Environment constrained (security and performances),
