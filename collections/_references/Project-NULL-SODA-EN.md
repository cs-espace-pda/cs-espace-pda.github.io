# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Evaluation of the SODA method to characterize gaseous contents in the atmosphere are as follows:
* Prototype development and results analysis

![Main Picture](Project-NULL-SODA-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Development of a prototype :**
* Atmospheric correction with SOS-ABS for different gas contents
* Calculations of SODA coefficients with two different methods 
* Estimation of the optimal content for each gas considered
	**Analysis of results :**
* Generation of a dataset to process from SOS-ABS for 9 different surfaces
* Selection of the optimal spectral interval for each gas
* Analysis of results based on surface type

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Evaluate a water vapor inversion method to restore other gaseous contents (O3, CO2, CH4, PSURF)

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Bibliography, Prototyping, Simulations, Analysis

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
