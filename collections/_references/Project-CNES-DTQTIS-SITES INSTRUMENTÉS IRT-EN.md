# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Flight calibration of TRISHNA on instrumented sites are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-SITES INSTRUMENTÉS IRT-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Simulation of uncertainty on a large number of atmospheric profiles (water vapor, ozone, temperature)
* Simulation of luminance at TOA using the RTTOV code from 4 to 12 microns
* Analysis of the impact on the observable luminance of the uncertainties on the profiles
* Application to the TRISHNA sensor

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Study the feasibility of an absolute calibration on an instrumented site for a spatial sensor in thermal infrared

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Study, regular meetings

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Processing model
