# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Precise Point Positioning with Integer and Zero-difference Ambiguity Resolution are as follows:
* Study, Development, Maintenance

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-PPP-WIZARD-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **PPP-Wizard :** Keeping in operative conditions the machines hosted at OVH
* Surveillance of the demonstrator (daily and long-term)
* Algorithm update
* Renting of supplementary machines hosted by OVH according to the Customer needs
	**PPP-User :** Development of new algorithms to increase the user position accuracy (instantaneous detection of the cycle slip, 4th Galileo frequency, BeiDouâ€¦), realized with the CNES engineers and experts team
	**Development of 2 applications : RTCM converter and PPP-WizLite**
