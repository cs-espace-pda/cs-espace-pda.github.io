# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Support in Task Delegation of MCO and Ground Operations of CCC ISIS Science are as follows:
* * Management of ground support for operations in Task Delegation by CS GROUP

![Main Picture](Project CNES-DT OPÉRATIONS SOL CCC ISIS SCIENCE-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Delegation of tasks for ground support in routine operation**: MCO and support for operations (shifts, on-call), support for tests, management of the Cluster Sciences Platform, integration and qualification of new LdP versions
	**Contribution to the shared AIV ISIS (MIG), to the shared exploitation layer (PULP) and to the AIV ClusterSciences**: AIV and testing of new versions of LdP, integration of new missions
	**Task delegation**: support for the definition, implementation and technical management of operations assistance tools

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Delegation of tasks for MRO and routine ground operations for scientific or civil missions based on the ISIS Product Line: SWOT missions, N3SS, ...

The processes for carrying out the project are:
