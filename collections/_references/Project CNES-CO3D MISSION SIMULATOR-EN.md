# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Mission CO3D Simulator are as follows:
* Development

![Main Picture](Project CNES-CO3D MISSION SIMULATOR-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Mission Programming Simulator
* Comparison of mission performance for different satellite or mission designs
* Long-term progress analysis of on-going projects (including bi-satellite stereo mapping of all the emerged lands),
* Comparison of mission performance regarding scheduled acquisitions properties
* Dimensioning needs evaluation (reservations of station passages, satellite memory, etc.).

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Realization of configurable and fast tools to simulate the mission programming of the land cover over a long term horizon in order to validate the industrial choices on the definition of the satellites and the constellation, and to study various programming alternatives ; 
* CO3D mission programming support

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* V Cycle

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Provide the client with powerful tools for analyzing programming alternatives over large horizons
* Provide an ability to understand mission issues
* Earth observation mission programming experience
* Development of mission simulators optimized in terms of calculation time.
* Responsiveness to customer needs.
