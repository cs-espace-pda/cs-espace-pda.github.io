* Generation of reference hyperspectra of desert sites 
* Application to calibration (MSI, OLCI, SLSTR)
	**TOA Spectral Integration for Deserts Calibration :**
* Adaptation of MUSCLE tools/Implementation of the algorithm
* BOA/TOA integration comparison (SPOT-6 and SLSTR calibrations)
	**Rayleigh/Glitter calibration :**
* Morel&Gentili BRDF correction development (MUSCLE-NEO integration in progress)
* Study on improving the spectral interpolation of reflectances CLIMZOO
