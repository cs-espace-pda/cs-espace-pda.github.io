# Context


![Main Picture](Project DGA-GEODE 4D-EN pict 1.png)

CS Group responsabilities are as follows:
* Architectural analysis and system definition
* Functional specification, 
* Committing financial proposition, 
* Realisation of mock ups and prototypes.


The features are as follows:
* Facilitates access to relevant data
* Insures its job consistency
* Elaborates and spreads the Recognized Environmental Picture (NATO concept)
* Mutualizes the environmental data exploitation, for the whole material and human army means
* Allows to reduce costs, delays and risks for the different programs exploiting these data
* Allows to improve interoperability and exchanges of geophysical environment related information between Defence systems and provide expertize tools and decision-making helping services.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* GEODE 4D is a project to set up a geophysical cross forces information system.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Software V-Model

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Modular and generic architecture design;
* Information Systems technological experience, including each environment-dedicated domain;
* Use of tools and software worldwide known for their efficiency;
* Use of Open-Source components to reduce both ownership and exploitation costs (licences,…).



The main technologies used in this project are:
