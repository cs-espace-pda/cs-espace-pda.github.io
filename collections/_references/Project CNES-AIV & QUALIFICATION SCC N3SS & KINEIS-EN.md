# Context


CS Group responsabilities for SCC IVV, support in Technical and Operational Qualification and LEOP of N3SS et KINEIS missions are as follows:
* * Piloting of the IVV by CS GROUP, TQ/OQ tests by CNES

![Main Picture](Project CNES-AIV & QUALIFICATION SCC N3SS & KINEIS-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **AIV**: development of LdP procedures and assignment, definition of strategy, plans and automated execution of tests (AIV tools for managing contexts, results, requirements)
	**QT/OQ System Tests**: preparation and support for the execution of compatibility/QT/OQ tests, development of ground operational procedures
	**Support to Operations**: resources integrated into the CNES teams for launch, in-flight acceptance and start of life (shifts, ground constraints)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Engineering assistance and support for carrying out the **integration and system qualification** of the components of the **Ground Control Segments of the N3SS Satellite and the KINEIS constellation** implementing the **ISIS Product Line**
* ISIS missionization and integration on science cluster and Cloud
* Development of the CNES/ESA/NASA IOAG demonstrator

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): JIRA
* Specific Process for Assembly, Integration, Validation Qualification of Control Ground Segments
* Qualification system tests of control ground segments: Compatibility, Technical and Operational Qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Configuration and deployment of SCCs: Nominal, Standby, SCP/SSV (experts) and test lines
* Operational qualification TM/TC ISIS chain: BDS configurations, sessions, SLE, COP, catalogs, TM visualization, TC histo
* Implementation of ISIS operational concepts: procedures, automation 
* Experienced AIV team for rapid upskilling
