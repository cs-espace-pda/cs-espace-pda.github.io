# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Absolute radiometric calibration - Studies for improving Sade -Muscle tools are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-AMELIORATION SADE-MUSCLE-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Improvement hyperspectral interpolation on deserted sites :**
* Analysis of available hyperspectres (Gome-2, Onera, Ecostress, Picsand)
* Generation of reference hyperspectres for desert sites 
* Application to calibration (MSI, OLCI, SLSTR)
	**Toa spectral integration for deserted calibration :**
* Adaptation of muscle/implementation of algorithm
* BOA/TOA integration comparison (Spot-6 and SLSTR calibrations)
	**Rayleigh/glitter calibration :**
* Development BRDF Morel & Gentili Correction (Integration Muscle-Neo in progress)
* Study on improving the spectral interpolation of air conditioning reflectances
