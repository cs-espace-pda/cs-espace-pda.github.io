# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Radiometric Calibration Expertise Support for Opt-MP-S2 are as follows:
* Guarantee the quality of the radiometric calibration parameters
* User support

![Main Picture](Project-ESA-ESA OPT-MPC RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Obscuity current monitoringÂ :**
*   Night acquisitions on Oceans. 
*   Analysis of the stability of the pixel of darkness by pixel and spectral band.
	**Monitoring of radiometric sensitivity and inter-pixel response :**
*   Sun-Diffuser image processing.
*   Analysis of equalization variations (FPN).
*   Followed by the evolution of the absolute calibration coefficients of S2A and S2B.
*   Method's sensitivity analysis.
	**Defective pixel monitoring :**
*   Identification of defective pixels (aberrants or buries).
*   Definition of the Pixels SWIR reselection configuration, monitoring of results on board.
