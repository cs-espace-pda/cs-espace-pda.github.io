# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Radiometric Calibration expertise support for the OPT-MPC-S2 are as follows:
* Guarantee the quality of radiometric calibration parameters
* User Support

![Main Picture](Project-ESA-ESA OPT-MPC RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Dark Current TrackingÂ :**
*   Night acquisitions on oceans. 
*   Analysis of dark current stability per pixel and spectral band.
	**Monitoring radiometric sensitivity and inter-pixel response :**
*   Sun-diffuser image processing.
*   Analysis of equalization variations (FPN).
*   Monitoring the evolution of the absolute calibration coefficients of S2A and S2B.
*   Sensitivity analysis of the method.
	**Bad Pixel Tracking :**
*   Identification of defective pixels (aberrant or noisy).
*   Setting SWIR pixel reselection configuration, monitoring results on board.
