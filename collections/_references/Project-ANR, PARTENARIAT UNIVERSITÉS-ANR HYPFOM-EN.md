# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Modeling the non-linear effects of the marine environment on radiation are as follows:
* Fine simulation of radiation in the water column
* Modeling of sub-surface rising radiation by separation of radiative terms

![Main Picture](Project-ANR, PARTENARIAT UNIVERSITÉS-ANR HYPFOM-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Fine characterization of the nonlinearity terms induced by the water column :**
* OSOAA simulations
* Support for comparison with simplified models
	**Modeling of sub-surface rising radiation by separation of radiative terms :**
* Expression of the rising luminance under the surface coming from a target pixel, with impact of neighboring pixels
* Estimation of the importance of reflections below the surface
* Modeling and evaluation of the impact of environmental effects on the rising signal
	**Development of a tool for simulating inter-pixel mixing in a uniform environment.**
