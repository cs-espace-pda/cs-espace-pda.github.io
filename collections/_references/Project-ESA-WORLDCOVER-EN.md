* Open source promoter

![Main Picture](Project-ESA-WORLDCOVER-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Produce, deliver and validate a global 10 meters land cover map of the world.
* Use a mapping of a minimum of 10 land cover classes and a minimum overall accuracy of 75%.
* Use innovative approaches that best exploit the novel observational capabilities of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data at an acceptable cost.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* The project aims at developing an automated user-driven workflow capable of producing a global land cover maps in fast delivery.
* To meet such a challenge, production delivery is divided into 3 phases:
	* Producing 1% of the world
	* Producing 10% of the world
	* Producing 100% of the world

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile
* Continuous integration

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* On-demand computing platform creation service 
* Useful service deployments without the complexity of managing a processing platform over a cloud infrastructure
