# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Sentinel-2 Mission Performance Center are as follows:
* Service management,
* ESL (Expert Support Laboratories) Coordination,
* ESL L1 Radiometry Lead,
* L1 Processor Prototyping (S2 IPF),
* L2A Processor Packaging (Sen2Cor),
* Tools Maintenance (QCC).

The features are as follows:
* Calibration – update on-board and on-ground configuration data to meet product quality requirements
* Validation – assess the quality of generated data products 
* Quality Control – routinely monitor sensor status and check if derived products meet quality requirements along mission lifetime
* Data processors evolutions definition
* L2A Processor&Tools corrective and perfective maintenance – manage updates of Sen2Cor,quality control tools,calibration tools and auxiliary files
* End-to-end system performance monitoring – monitor performance of Sentinel-2 system operations(including the instrument)and assess the system
