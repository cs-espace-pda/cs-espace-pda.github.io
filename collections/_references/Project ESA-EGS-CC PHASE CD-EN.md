# Context

Team: 2 to 6 persons

CS Group responsabilities for European Ground System – Common Core – Phase C/D - Development are as follows:
* Development, Maintenance

![Main Picture](Project ESA-EGS-CC PHASE CD-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* As part of EGS-CC development consortium (led by Telespazio), CS GROUP has been involved in the implementation of data distribution and access components: __KE-INF-DD__: Data Distribution component; __KE-INF-SDA__: Source Data Access component.
* One of the key challenges of Mission Control Systems is their ability to process and transfer large amount of data in a very efficient way. Components developed by CS GROUP are based on a message-oriented middleware following a peer-to-peer approach

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* The EGS-CC infrastructure to support monitoring and control systems is based on three layers: __Kernel__: generic M&C functionalities for any target application, and a common framework to build systems; __Reference implementations__: components that may be replaced individually; __Reference Test Facility__: test environment to support validation of EGS-CC.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Development cycle: the development of the EGS-CC components is based on an incremental and iterative approach. EGS-CC subsystems are  progressively assembled, integrated and validated. 
* Development environment: the EGS-CC SDE is used by all consortium members.

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Very good knowledge of the overall EGS-CC development requirements and lifecycle.
* Thorough hands-on experience with all tools of the EGS-CC SDE.
* High level of flexibility and commitment.
