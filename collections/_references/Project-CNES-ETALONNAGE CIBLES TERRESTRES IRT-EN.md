# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Calibration methods on terrestrial targets in thermal infrared - Applicability to TRISHNA are as follows:
* Bibliographic research, synthesis



The features are as follows:
* **Identification of IRT sensor calibration methods and applicability analysis to TRISHNA :**
*     TIRS / Landsat-8 (marine targets with buoys, instrumented terrestrial sites, inter-calibration), 
*     ECOSTRESS, ASTER/TIR (instrumented terrestrial sites),
*     MODIS Airborne Simulator (field measurement campaigns).
	**Identification of data networks used for absolute calibration in VIS-SWIR and IRT.** 
	**Identification of inter-sensor calibration methods (SNO, SIC, DDM methods).**
	**Identification of the impact of BRDF in IRT and correction procedures.**
