# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Calibration methods on terrestrial targets in thermal infrared - Applicability in Trishna are as follows:
* Bibliographic research, synthesis



The features are as follows:
* **Identification of IRT sensor calibration methods and applicability analysis in Trishna :**
*     Shots / Landsat-8 (sea targets with buoys, instrumented terrestrial sites, inter-business), 
*     Ecostress, aster/shooting (instrumented terrestrial sites),
*     Modis Airborne Simulator (field measurement campaigns).
	**Identification of data networks used for absolute calibration in the screw-swir and IRT.** 
	**Identification of inter-capsal calibration methods (SNO, SIC, DDM methods).**
	**Identification of the impact of BRDF in IRT and correction approaches.**
