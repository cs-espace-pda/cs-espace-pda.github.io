# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Support for ground operations of the Maintenance Center at Post Helios 2A / 2B are as follows:
* Strengthen CNES teams, maintain CMPs in operational conditions, respect operational constraints

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-HELIOS CMP OPERATIONS GROUND SUPPORT-EN pict 2.jpg)

The features are as follows:
* **Operation of CMP**, namely :
* 24-hour SOL on-call: operational monitoring of conf. hardware and software
* Monitoring of installations, guarantee of software integrity
* Participation in operational meetings 
* Test support for the Bord, Mission and Orbito teams
	**Technical management of subsystems** (STS, DUTCH, CGCU, EGM, OMGS, FOS/ARPE, CCS, etc.), namely :
* Monitoring of software vis-à-vis the industrial resp. maintenance 
* Validation of new versions
* On-call support for software problems
* Preparation for CNES software monitoring commissions

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Ensure operations for the SOL operating service of the Station Maintenance Centers of HELIOS satellites by delegation of tasks
* MCO (Maintenance in operational conditions) of the ground means used to ensure the operations of the HELIOS sector satellites

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* V Cycle

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Maintaining skills to ensure MCO and support for operations over a very long period



The main technologies used in this project are:
