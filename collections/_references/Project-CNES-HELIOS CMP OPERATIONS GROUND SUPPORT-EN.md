# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Support for soil operations of the Helios 2A / 2B post maintenance center are as follows:
* Strengthen CNES teams, maintain CMPs in operational conditions, comply with operational constraints

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-HELIOS CMP OPERATIONS GROUND SUPPORT-EN pict 2.jpg)

The features are as follows:
* **Exploitation of CMP **, namely :
* 24 -hour soil penalty: Conf exploitation monitoring. hardware and software
* Monitoring of installations, guarantee of the integrity of software
* Participation in operational meetings 
* Supports at the tests of the team, mission, orbito teams
	**Technical management of subsystems ** (STS, Dutch, CGCU, EGM, OMGS, FOS/ARPE, CCS, ...), namelyÂ :
* Software monitoring with regard to the industrial resp. maintenance 
* Validation of new versions
* Support for on -call duty if software problems
* Preparation for CNES software monitoring commissions

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Ensure operations for the operating floor service for positions to post Helios satellites as a delegation of tasks
* MCO (Maintaining operational conditions) of the Middle Sol used to ensure the operations of satellites in the Helios sector

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* V Cycle

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Maintaining skills to ensure the MCO and support for operations over a very long period
