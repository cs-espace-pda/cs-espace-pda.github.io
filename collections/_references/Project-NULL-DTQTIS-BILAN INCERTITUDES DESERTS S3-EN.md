# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Uncertainty assessment of the Deserts calibration for SENTINEL3 sensors are as follows:
* Study, Development

![Main Picture](Project-NULL-DTQTIS-BILAN INCERTITUDES DESERTS S3-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Adaptation of an existing tool (R&T CNES) to the SENTINEL3 case
* Analysis of the existing situation (code & A.T.B.D.) => proposal for improvements and corrections 
* Development / Testing of improvements
* Quantification of standard uncertainties provided as input to the code (BRDF, interpolation, radiative transfer, radiometry)
* Application to the case of calibration of OLCI and SLSTR sensors 
* Extension for use with SENTINEL2 (To be finalized)

# Project implementation
