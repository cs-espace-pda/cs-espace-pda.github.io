# Context


CS Group responsabilities for BPDF models and high -space applicability are as follows:
* Bibliographic research, synthesis, simulations



The features are as follows:
* Identification of BPDF models in scientific literature (natural or artificial surfaces).
* Application of the Maignan code to assess the Nadal, Br√©on, Maignan and Litvinov models on Polder data.
* Simulation of the polarized field in the TOA with the SOS radiative transfer code.
* Analysis of the angular and spectral variation of the degree of polarization (DOP) on the surface and toa.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Bibliographical review of BIRECTIONAL POLARIZATION MODELS (BPDF) adaptable to high spatial resolution sensors.
* Application test of these models to discretize the types of surfaces observable from space.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Bibliography, study, simulations, regular meetings

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Incommensurate



The main technologies used in this project are:
