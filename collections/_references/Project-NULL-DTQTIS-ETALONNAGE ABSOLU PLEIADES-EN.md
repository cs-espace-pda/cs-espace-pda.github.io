# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Studies for absolute calibration and MTF measurement of PLEIADES sensors (Star & MOON Methods) are as follows:
* Study, treatments, development

![Main Picture](Project-NULL-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE ABSOLU PLEIADES-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **PHR1A & PHR1B Star Calibration:**
* Generation of Starpools using the ICC Isatis procedure
* Adding new Starpools to previously used data
* Analysis of new input data: time series trace of the digital count of each star for the Pléiades 1A and 1B Starpools and for different extraction window sizes
* Estimation of absolute and FTM calibration coefficients
	**LUNE PNEO3&PNEO4 calibration:**
* Carrying out pre-treatments and calibration treatments for PNEO3&PNEO4
* Evolution of calibration and synthesis tools to refine the analysis of results
