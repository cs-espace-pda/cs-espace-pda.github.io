![Main Picture](Project-NULL-EGS-CC POC-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Detailed technologies analysis based on criteria defined in order to meet the relevant EGS-CC requirements.
* Trade-off tests to ensure the best overall assemble of technologies working together.
* PoC implementation and performance tests to ensure that the selected technologies are compliant with the EGS-CC requirements, mainly in the area of performance requirements and key functional requirements which depend on technologies and third party products

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* The European Ground Systems – Common Core (EGS-CC) is a European initiative to develop a common infrastructure to support space systems monitoring and control in pre- and post-launch phases for all types of missions.
* The EGS-CC POC project is responsible for the analysis and selection of technologies potentially applicable to the EGS-CC system.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Proof of Concept, analysis and selection of technologies potentially applicable to the EGS-CC system.

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* The EGS-CC has adopted for the technology selection process a set of criteria based on the FURPS+ model developed by Hewlett Packard and extending it with EGS-CC specific. This set of criteria has been refined at the start of the project, and applied throughout the work as part of the different activities performed.
* Key aspects of the EGS-CC prototyped.
