# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Development of a platform for the development and publication of SCALABLE, AGILE and “DEVOPS ready” geospatial services are as follows:
* Design, development and deployment on CNES HPC, Cloud, DIAS. Integration of partner contributions. Help Desk, Documentation, User Support

![Main Picture](Project-CS GROUP (FINANCEMENT BPI)-AI4GEO-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* Provide an **artificial intelligence oriented interactive development environment for Earth Observation (EO) data**
* Allow execution of processing on **large amounts of data**
	**Scaling** different AI technologies in EO on Cloud and HPC environments
	**Facilitate the integration of existing AI processing chains**
	**Standardize interfaces** for calling processing chains (porting, standards, API, etc.)
* Make image processing chains more flexible in terms of evolution (**DevOps**).

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Study, design and publish a **turnkey** massive processing platform, **optimized** for 2D/3D analysis and artificial intelligence in the field of Earth Observation (EO).
* Used as a **base platform of the AI4GEO project**, carried out in partnership with CNES, ONERA, IGN, Airbus, CLS, GeoSat, QuantCube

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile method

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* **Online** environment, accessible through a browser, **without plugin**
* Simplified access to data, regardless of the Data Provider
* Transparent management of the CNES DataLake
* Batteries included: from scientific libraries to heavy applications
* Dynamic and interactive visualization of results in 1D, 2D and 3D
* Centralized and secure access
