# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Big Data from Space – Reference Architecture Framework are as follows:
* Design, Development, Integration and Maintenance,
* Open source Promoter.

![Main Picture](Project-ESA-BIDSRAF-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Providing CaaS provider-agnostic to automatically create and manage ICT easily deploy micro-services.
* Defining interoperable service and data management interfaces within a multi-cloud orchestration system.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Creating a reliable and scalable multi-cloud computing infrastructure and data management platform relevant for Earth data processing

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile, Continuous integration

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* On-demand computing platform creation service.
* Useful service deployments without the complexity of managing a processing platform over a cloud infrastructure (WPS Service).
