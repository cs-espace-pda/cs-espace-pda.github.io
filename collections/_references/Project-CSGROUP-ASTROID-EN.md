# Context

ASTROID is a France Relance project and aims to boost the market access of 8 nanosatellite technologies resulting from French R&D, thanks to a first in-orbit demonstration, a consortium approach and the international promotion of the results acquired for each partner.

CS Group responsabilities for Demonstration of satellite and Control Centre are as follows:
* Design, development, int√©gration, maintenance & operation

The features are as follows:
* ASTROID (Advanced Satellite Technology, Radio Occultation and IoD Demonstrator) :
*     It is the first project to use GOSMIC products:
*     CSNano (Control Center) and SPnode (Scheduler)
*     OREFLIDS (Flight Dynamics System)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* ASTROID consists of testing in orbit on an HEMERIA nano-satellite platform the equipment and technological solutions of 6 partners (ANYWAVES, COMAT, CSGROUP, MECANO-ID, STEEL & SYNTONY) in order to qualify them in an operational environment.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Cloud native (Kubernetes) Micro-services architecture
