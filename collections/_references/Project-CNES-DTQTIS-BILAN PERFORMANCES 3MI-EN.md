# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Absolute radiometric calibration - Performance assessment 3MI are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-BILAN PERFORMANCES 3MI-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Development of a simulator applying a calibration error to parasol measures and making a statistical analysis of the impact on radiometry.**
	**Application to sensitivity estimates :**
*     - Uncertainties on the orientation of polarizers
*     - ignorance of the extinction rate of polarizers 
*     - Error on the relative transmission between channels of a triplet of polarizers
*     - HF equalization noise and radiometric noise
*     - Non-linearity error

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Analyze 3MI's performance with regard to specifications

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Study, regular meetings

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Reference simulated images
* Inversion module of level L1 to measurement
* Instrumental radiometric model modification module
* Module of passage of measurements to data L1
* Images generated with calibration error
* Module for analyzing the differences between images
