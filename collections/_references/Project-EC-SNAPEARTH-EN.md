# Context


CS Group responsabilities for SnapEarth are as follows:
* Design, Development, Integration

![Main Picture](Project-EC-SNAPEARTH-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* Index Sentinel images for easy access via a Qwant "EarthSearch" engine. 
* 4 pilot projects aim to take advantage of this indexing with the implementation of the services: Agriculture, Press, Climate and Food-Security. 
* The EarthSelf-Service enables any business or user to take advantage of highly scalable cloud environments for analysis, visualization and production of EO value-added services.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Fostering EO market uptake thanks to natural and holistic access to added value data generated through cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technologies

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile, Continuous integration

# Technical characteristics
