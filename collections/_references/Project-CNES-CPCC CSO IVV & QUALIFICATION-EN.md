# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Support for the qualification of the CPCC CSO for the launches of the Reco1 (2018) and IDER (2020) satellite satellites

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): Testlink and Excel
* Specific assembly process, integration, validation qualification of control soil segments
* Tests qualification system for control soil segments: compatibility, technical and operational qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Successful implementation of a 1st functional alternative solution in less than 6 months based on operation
* Very tense planning trying for the teams
* Strong responsiveness of the development team
* Deployment of a multisat solution on an operational monosat center
* Complex mission: chronology of bi-satellite activities, satellite embarking the coa
