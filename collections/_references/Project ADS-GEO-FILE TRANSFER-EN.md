# Context

File transfer Service ensures massive files data exchange between GDS sub-systems and others services of system.
Optional pre/post processing are realized on the data transferred.
* The data exchange are launched either automatically by polling storages, either by receiving messages (MessageQueuing) or demands (WebService),
* Optional pre/post processing are realized on the data transferred,
* The data are transferred from input storage to recipient(s) storage.

CS Group responsabilities are as follows:
* Maintenance, Reversibility


The features are as follows:
* Transfers start automatically by polling storages or by receiving messages (MessageQueuing) or requests (WebService)
* Manages both cloud and local storage
* Three entry points: Message Queuing service, REST API, MMI for supervisor accounts
* Monitors transfer data process: error handling, transfers status management, logs management
* Authentication: from service IAM and LDAP
* MMI proposes to: 
	* monitor the transfers process,
	* create units and routes,
	* monitor file transferâ€™s systems.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* File transfer Service ensures massive files data exchange between GDS sub-systems and others services of system.
* Optional pre/post processing are realized on the data transferred.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Continuous integration
* Requirements engineering

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* RESTfull web services architecture (BackEnd) 
* Independent software components provide great modularity
* Load-balancing mechanism
* Redundancy system
* Structure based on container platforms (docker)
