* Manages both cloud and local storage
* Three entry points: Message Queuing service, REST API, MMI for supervisor accounts
* Monitors transfer data process: error handling, transfers status management, logs management
* Authentication: from service IAM and LDAP
* MMI proposes to: 
	* monitor the transfers process,
	* create units and routes,
	* monitor file transferâ€™s systems.

# Project implementation
