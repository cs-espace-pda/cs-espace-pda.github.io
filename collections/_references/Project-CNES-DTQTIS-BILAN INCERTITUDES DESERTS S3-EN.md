# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Uncertainties of the deserted calibration for the sensors Sentinel3 are as follows:
* Study, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-BILAN INCERTITUDES DESERTS S3-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Adaptation of an existing tool (R&T CNES) to the Sentinel3 case
* Analysis of the existing (Code & A.T.B.D.) => Proposal for improvements and corrections 
* Development / testing of improvements
* Quantification of the typical uncertainties provided at the input of the code (BRDF, interpolation, radiative transfer, radiometry)
* Application to the calibration of OLCI and SLSTR sensors 
* Extension for use with Sentinel2 (to be finalized)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty of the deserted calibration method. Application to S3.

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Bibliography, code analysis / improvements, development, validation, actual data application, reports

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Incommensurate
