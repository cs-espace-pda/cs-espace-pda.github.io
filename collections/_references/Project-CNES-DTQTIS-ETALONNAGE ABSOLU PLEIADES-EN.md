# Context


CS Group responsabilities for Studies for absolute calibration and FTM measurement of Pleiades sensors (Star & Moon methods) are as follows:
* Study, treatments, development

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-DTQTIS-ETALONNAGE ABSOLU PLEIADES-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* **Phr1a & phr1b stalking stalks:**
* Generation of starpools using the ICC Isatis procedure
* Addition of new Starpools to previously used data
* Analysis of new input data: trace of time series of the digital account of each star for Starpools Pléiades 1A and 1B and for different sizes of extraction windows
* Estimation of absolute calibration coefficients and FTM
	**Pneo3 & pneo4 moon stalker:**
* Realization of pre-working and calibration treatments for pneo3 & pneo4
* Evolution of calibration and synthesis tools to refine the analysis of the results

# Project implementation
