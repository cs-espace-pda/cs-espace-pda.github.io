# Context


CS Group responsabilities for 3D Optical Constellation CO3D Image Processing are as follows:
* Design, Development, Integration and Maintenance,

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-CODIP-EN pict 1.png)

The features are as follows:
* Implementation of an operational processing chain in micro-services, orchestrated in the cloud via Zeebe.
* 2D and 3D production (stereo 3D reconstruction)
* CODIP deployed in several operational centers, in particular on the cloud.

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Development for the CO3D constellation of the CODIP image processing chain: CO3D Image Processing
* Combined application of the agile Scrum method and the DevOps approach

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Agile Scrum method
* Continuous Cloud Deployment

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Algorithmic blocks of the chain cut into dockerized micro-services
*     Service layer in Python
*     Binding C++ for algo processing binaries
* Data exchange via S3 storage
* Service orchestration with Zeebe
* Strong scalability via cloud deployment
