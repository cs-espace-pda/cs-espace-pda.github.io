# Context


CS Group responsabilities for SSC IVV, support in Technical and Operational Qualification and LEOP of CERES mission are as follows:
* * Piloting of the IVV by CS GROUP, TQ/OQ tests by CNES

![Main Picture](Project-CNES-SSC CERES IVV & QUALIFICATION-EN pict 2.png)

The features are as follows:
* **AIV **: Development of LDP procedures and missionary, definition of strategy, automated plans and execution of tests (AIV tools for managing contexts, results, requirements)
	**QT/QO ** system tests: preparation and support for the execution of compatibility/qt/qo tests, development of operational procedures
	**Support for operations **: Resources integrated in CNES teams for launch, the recipe in flight and beginning of life (shifts, soil clips)

# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Assistance to engineering and support for the realization of ** Integration and System Qualification ** of the components of the ** Segments Control of the Ceres ** Satellites ** the ** Line of Isis products**
* First missionary and integration of the ISIS LDP
* Defense context: strong security constraints

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): Testlink and Excel
* Specific assembly process, integration, validation qualification of control soil segments
* Tests qualification system for control soil segments: compatibility, technical and operational qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Configuration and deployment of SSCs: nominal, rescue, SCP/SSV (experts) and 10 test lines
* 1st operational qualification channel TM/TC Isis: BDS configurations, sessions, SLE, COP, Catalogs, TM visualization, TC Histo
* 1st implementation of ISIS operational concepts: procedures, automation 
* Experienced AIV team including experts
