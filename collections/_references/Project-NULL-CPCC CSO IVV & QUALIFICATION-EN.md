# Project implementation

The project objectives are as follows:
* Support for the qualification of the CPCC CSO for the launches of the RECO1 (2018) and IDENT (2020) satellites

The processes for carrying out the project are:
* Requirements management (STB, IF): Testlink and Excel
* Specific process of Assembly, Integration, Validation Qualification of Ground Control Segments
* Ground control segment qualification system tests: Compatibility, Technical and Operational Qualification

# Technical characteristics

The solution key points are as follows:
* Successful implementation of a first functional alternative solution in less than 6 months based on OpenCenter
* Very tense schedule, testing for the teams
* Strong responsiveness of the development team
* Deployment of a multisat solution on an operational single-sat center
* Complex mission: chronology of bi-satellite activities, satellite carrying the COA
